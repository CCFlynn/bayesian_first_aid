{"name":"Bayesian First Aid","tagline":"Replacing the null hypothesis tests in R by Bayesian estimation, one test at a time.","body":"The idea with this R package is to make \"replacements\" for the most commonly used tests in R such as `t.test`, `binom.test` and `cor.test`. These replacements will be based on Bayesian estimation and will in that sense neither be \"null hypothesis\" nor \"tests\". They will be replacements in that they will have similar assumptions as the original tests and will answer the the same type of question as one probably have when using the corresponding null hypothesis test.\r\n\r\nThe gimmick of the package is that the Bayesian versions have functions calls that are compatible with the classical tests' functions. That is going from a classical binomial test:\r\n\r\n``` r\r\nbinom.test(x=7, n=10)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n\tExact binomial test\r\n\r\ndata:  7 and 10\r\nnumber of successes = 7, number of trials = 10, p-value = 0.01855\r\nalternative hypothesis: true probability of success is not equal to 0.33\r\n95 percent confidence interval:\r\n 0.3475 0.9333\r\nsample estimates:\r\nprobability of success \r\n                   0.7 \r\n```\r\n\r\n... to the Bayesian estimation version is as easy as prepending `bayes.` to the function call:\r\n\r\n``` r\r\nbayes.binom.test(x=7, n=10, p=0.33)\r\n```\r\n```\r\n\tBayesian first aid binomial test\r\n\r\ndata: 7 and 10\r\nnumber of successes = 7, number of trials = 10\r\nEstimated relative frequency of success:\r\n  0.669 \r\n95% credible interval:\r\n  0.42 0.91 \r\nThe relative frequency of success is more than 0.33 by a probability of 0.993 \r\nand less than 0.33 by a probability of 0.007 \r\n```\r\n\r\nHence the name of the package: Bayesian First Aid.","google":"UA-15535612-10","note":"Don't delete this file!
